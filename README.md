# 💸 PricePilot – Elasticity Modeling & Pricing Optimization

## 🎯 Objective  
Model price elasticity of demand to identify optimal pricing strategies that maximize revenue and minimize churn.

## 🧪 Business Context  
Pricing decisions directly impact revenue and customer behavior. Elasticity modeling helps quantify sensitivity and guide pricing strategy across products and segments.

## 🧠 Workflow  
- Simulate price and demand data  
- Fit regression model to estimate elasticity  
- Calculate revenue at each price point  
- Identify optimal price for maximum revenue  
- Recommend pricing strategy

## 📊 Key Insights  
- Elasticity = -1.42  
- Optimal price = ₹1,050  
- Actionable pricing recommendations for revenue optimization
